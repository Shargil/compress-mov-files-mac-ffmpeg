**Tired of 4GB .MOV video files clogging up your Mac's expensive SSD storage?**

1. Run this script in the Terminal:

        bash compress_mov_files.sh
2. Drag and drop .MOV files
3. Type "Start"
4. When finished check that the new files are working
5. Delete the "Original Files - DELETE if all went OK" folder.
