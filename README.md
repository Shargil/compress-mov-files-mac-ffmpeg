# compress-mov-files-mac-ffmpeg
**Tired of 4GB .MOV video files clogging up your Mac's expensive SSD storage?**

1. Run this script in the Terminal:

        bash compress_video_files.sh
2. Drag and drop video files (there is a limit on the string size you can paste)
3. Type "Start"
4. When finished check that the new files are working
5. Delete the "Original Files - DELETE if all went OK" folder.

**Need to download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac) and [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) for mac**
